# Material Designer

Overview:

This is a take home project from Exabyte-io (https://github.com/Exabyte-io/rewotes/blob/dev/Materials-Designer.md)
The purpose of the app is to build a UI that displays a file's contents (.xyz) and a 3D representation of the contents.

I will be using React/vite and Three.js

Some Background/Thoughts:
I have never used Three.js or worked with the file types POSCAR and XYZ.
From what I've read, those file types aren't standardized. For example, xyz files will display a coord on a single line. This coord line CAN start with a element's symobl or not and the xyz coords can be separated by a space, tab, comma, or comma+space.

From the projects repo:

Requirements:
Build a general layout with focus areas (eg. toolbar, structure viewer, source viewer)
Implement two edit modes:
source editor (to edit material in textual representation)
visual editor (to adjust material visual representation)
Support import from a file format, (eg. POSCAR, XYZ)

Expectations:
up and running application OR high fidelity clickable mockups
general IDE layout (e.g. menu, toolboxes)
reactive material editor (edit material file â†’ immediately see results on 3D representation)
clean and documented code
tests
